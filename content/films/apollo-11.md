From director Todd Douglas Miller (Dinosaur 13) comes a cinematic event
fifty years in the making.
<!--more-->
Crafted from a newly discovered trove of 65mm
footage, and more than 11,000 hours of uncatalogued audio recordings,
Apollo 11 takes us straight to the hear t of NASA’s most celebrated
mission—the one that first put men on the moon, and forever made Neil
Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin into household names. Immersed in the perspectives
of the astronauts, the team in Mission Control, and the millions of
spectators on the ground, we vividly experience those momentous days
and hours in 1969 when humankind took a giant leap into the future.
